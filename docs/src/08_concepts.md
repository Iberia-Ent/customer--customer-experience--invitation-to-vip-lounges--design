# Cross-cutting Concepts

This section describes overall, principal solution ideas that are relevant in multiple parts (= cross-cutting) of your system. Such concepts are often related to multiple building blocks. They can include many different topics, such as:

- Models, especially domain models
- Architecture or design patterns
- Rules for using specific technology

We must provide conceptual integrity (consistency, homogeneity) of the architecture.
