## Context *(MANDATORY)*

- Get the information about the invitations related to an Iberia Card type.
- The system that should manage this information is IAGL system that is responsible to manage loyalty system in IBERIA.
- At the moment of writing this ADR IAGL doesn't have this information.

### Functional Requirements *(OPTINAL)*

- To manage the invitations to fastTrack and lounges it is required to know the number of invitations associated to a Iberia card type.

## Decision *(MANDATORY)*

- Develop a tactical internal microservice that manage the number of invitations associated a Iberia card type.
- Once IAGL has this information then it is mandatory to refactor de service to go against IAGL endpoints.

### Justification *(MANDATORY)*

- We can't depend on IAGL endpoints for this development.

### Risks *(OPTIONAL)*

- The main risk is that IAGL never develops this funcionality.
- When IAGL is ready, we don't refactor the code because we don't have resources.

## Conclusion *(MANDATORY)*

- Developing this simple microservice allows CX have the functionality of VIP Lounges in time.
- The code should be dessigned to Refactor the code easily to IAGL endpoints.
