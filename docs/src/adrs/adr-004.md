## Context *(MANDATORY)*

- The VIP lounges invitations initiative requires two functionalities related with CRM:
    - Output: Send email to VIP and/or guest.
    - Inbound: Receive a call from SalesForce to redeem the QR Code.

It has been defined that all the communications with SalesForce must go through CRM Cloud initiative.

### Assumptions *(MANDATORY)*

- CRM Cloud hasn't priorized these two functionalities, and there are no estimated timelines yet.


## Decision *(MANDATORY)*

- For now, comunication will occur directly between Cx account and Salesforces.
- Once CRM cloud has the developments ready, it is committed to switching the comunication to CRM cloud endpoints.

### Justification *(MANDATORY)*

- The Invitations Manager initiative has a deadline of October 2025, and CRM Cloud is not yet ready.

- It is important to migrate the communication to CRM Cloud initiative when it becomes available.
