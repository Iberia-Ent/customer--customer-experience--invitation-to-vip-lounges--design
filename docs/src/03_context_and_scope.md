## Business Context Optional (OPTIONAL)

The Customer Experience (CX) Platform is undergoing the digital transformation strategy of Iberia, aimed at improving passenger engagement and operational efficiency. Its purpose is to centralize, enrich, and expose ancillary-related information (such as meals, boutique purchases and onboard services) through a decoupled, event-driven architecture.

Inside the web application portal, a visual item will provide Iberia customers with the capability to order invitations to third-party travellers in order to access the VIP lounges. Determining if the invitation can be performed or not will depend upon a set of business rules.
